# C++-based Python package for fast computing of the Mandelbrot set

### The Mandelbrot set

A point `c = a + ib` in the complex plane is in the Mandelbrot set if the following series does not diverge as n tends to infinity :

A point that isn't inside the set will always be greater than any radius `R > 2` at some point of the iteration.

A point inside will typically be colored black.

### The coloring

The typical way to color the rest of the set (the outside points) is to have the color as a function of the number of iterations before escaping the radius (c.f. previous image). 
However, the coloring technique here is called average stripe coloring and works as such :

The 'orbit' is the collection of the points (f_i) which are then mapped by a function. By taking the average of the mapped orbits and mapping that number to a color, you get a coloring that can look like this :

To have an output between 0 and 1, the function is chosen as such :

with the stripe density, s_d visually chosen to be 2.   
This output is then put into a matplotlib colormap to have RGB values.


### Number of iterations

The number `n` of maximum iterations is a very important parameter, since it determines both the quality and precision of the image but also the speed at which it renders.  
A typical image is 1000 by 1000 pixels, and each of the pixels will be iterated through the process of zÂ²+c `n` times, and then be taken through the average stripe coloring prcess.

Here is the effect of the parameter on a certain zoomed point of the complex plane :

### Speed
For a benchmark image (1000x1000, 500it)

Basic python implementation : 72s  
Parallelized numpy : 0.512s  
My package (1 core CPU): 0.492s  
My package (8 logical cores, CPU) : 0.129s  

### Results

All found in one sontinuous zoom to the point -1.62411991934 + i * (-0.00013088927)
